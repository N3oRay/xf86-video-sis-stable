Tested to work on Xorg 1.20
with [SiS]:
- 671 / 672 Mirage 3D
- 65x/M650/740

Known issues with Xorg versions without XAA support:
- No hardware acceleration
- No video acceleration aka XvMC

How to download, build and install this driver:

# Install required packages
sudo apt-get install git make autoconf xorg-dev xutils-dev mesa-common-dev libdrm-dev libtool 

# download
git clone https://github.com/ace2nutzer/xf86-video-sis-stable.git
cd xf86-video-sis-stable

# cleanup
make -j2 clean
make -j2 distclean

# build the driver
./autogen.sh
make -j2

# install the driver
sudo make -j2 install

# install xorg.conf for LCD with 1280x800 pixels
# EXA version (*)
sudo cp xorg.conf.exa /etc/X11/xorg.conf
# or for some older Ubuntu (based) distros V.12.04 with XAA support
sudo cp xorg.conf /etc/X11

# install XvMC config (for video hardware acceleration)
sudo cp XvMCConfig /etc/X11
# or for some older Ubuntu (based) distros V.12.04 with XAA support
sudo cp XvMCConfig /usr/lib/xvmcconfig-standard

# optional, but recommended:
# use your console in text mode to improve scrolling (up to 3x faster!)
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
# uncomment "GRUB_TERMINAL=console" in order to disable graphical terminal (grub-pc only)
# save with Strg+X  then Y then ENTER
# update bootloader
sudo update-grub

# reboot and enjoy !

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# (*) NOTICE: EXA version
# Option "ShadowFB"
# This option enables the shadow raster buffer layer. By default it is disabled.
# If this option is enabled, the driver will cause the CPU to do each drawing operation first into a shadow frame buffer 
# in system virtual memory and then copy the result into video memory. 
# If this option is not active, the CPU will draw directly into video memory. 
# Enabling this option is beneficial for those systems where reading from video memory is, on average, 
# slower than the corresponding read/modify/write operation in system virtual memory. 
# This is normally the case for PCI or AGP adapters, and, so, this option is enabled by default unless acceleration is enabled.

# EXA works both with and without DRI. Depending on the actual hardware, things may be slower or faster with DRI enabled. 
# As a rule of thumb, rendering glyphs and small things are faster without DRI, 
# but if EXA feels like copying a big area from screen to memory, the X server may hang for a second or so while this is happening, 
# if DRI is not enabled.

# YOU SHOULD REALLY HAVE 64 MB VIDEO MEMORY SET IN BIOS WHEN USING A COMPOSITE MANAGER!!! Consider yourself advised.
# Some applications, like later versions of konqueror seem dead slow with EXA and composite acceleration.
