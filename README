Tested to work on Xorg 1.20
with [SiS]:
- 671 / 672 Mirage 3D
- 65x/M650/740

Known issues with Xorg versions without XAA support:
- No hardware acceleration
- No video acceleration aka XvMC

How to download, build and install this driver:

# Install required packages
sudo apt-get install git make autoconf xorg-dev xutils-dev mesa-common-dev libdrm-dev libtool 

# download
git clone https://github.com/ace2nutzer/xf86-video-sis-stable.git
cd xf86-video-sis-stable

# cleanup
make -j2 clean
make -j2 distclean

# build the driver
./autogen.sh
make -j2

# install the driver
sudo make -j2 install

# install xorg.conf for LCD with 1280x800 pixels
# EXA version (*)
sudo cp xorg.conf.exa /etc/X11/xorg.conf
# or for some older Ubuntu (based) distros V.12.04 with XAA support
sudo cp xorg.conf /etc/X11

# install XvMC config (for video hardware acceleration)
sudo cp XvMCConfig /etc/X11
# or for some older Ubuntu (based) distros V.12.04 with XAA support
sudo cp XvMCConfig /usr/lib/xvmcconfig-standard

# optional, but recommended:
# use your console in text mode to improve scrolling (up to 3x faster!)
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
# uncomment "GRUB_TERMINAL=console" in order to disable graphical terminal (grub-pc only)
# save with Strg+X  then Y then ENTER
# update bootloader
sudo update-grub

# reboot and enjoy !

# (*) NOTICE: EXA version
# Option "ShadowFB"
# This option enables the shadow raster buffer layer. By default it is disabled.
# If this option is enabled, the driver will cause the CPU to do each drawing operation first into a shadow frame buffer 
# in system virtual memory and then copy the result into video memory. 
# If this option is not active, the CPU will draw directly into video memory. 
# Enabling this option is beneficial for those systems where reading from video memory is, on average, 
# slower than the corresponding read/modify/write operation in system virtual memory. 
# This is normally the case for PCI or AGP adapters, and, so, this option is enabled by default unless acceleration is enabled.

# EXA works both with and without DRI. Depending on the actual hardware, things may be slower or faster with DRI enabled. 
# As a rule of thumb, rendering glyphs and small things are faster without DRI, 
# but if EXA feels like copying a big area from screen to memory, the X server may hang for a second or so while this is happening, 
# if DRI is not enabled.

# YOU SHOULD REALLY HAVE 64 MB VIDEO MEMORY SET IN BIOS WHEN USING A COMPOSITE MANAGER!!! Consider yourself advised.
# Some applications, like later versions of konqueror seem dead slow with EXA and composite acceleration.

Option   "FastVram"   "true"
Enable or disable FastVram mode.  Enabling this sets the video RAM timing
to one cycle per read operation instead of two cycles. Disabling this will
set two cycles for read and write operations. Leaving this option out uses
the default, which varies depending on the chipset.


Option   "NoHostBus"   "true"
(SiS5597/5598 only). Disable CPU-to-VGA host bus support. This
speeds up CPU to video RAM transfers. Default: Host bus is enabled.

Option   "MaxXFBMem"   "12288"

exists. This option must be set to the same value as given to sisfb through
its "mem" parameter, ie the amount of memory to use for X in kilobytes.

If you started sisfb without the mem argument, sisfb will reserve
12288KB if more than 16MB of total video RAM is available,
8192KB if between 12 and 16MB of video RAM is available,
4096KB in all other cases.

Option   "DRI"   "true"
This option allows enabling or disabling DRI. By default, DRI is on.

Option   "AGPSize"   "8"
This option allows selecting the amount of AGP memory to be used for DRI.
The amount is to be specified in megabyte, the default is 8.
